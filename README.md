### Introduction to Dart OOP
In this section, you will learn the basics of object-oriented programming and how it applies to Dart. We'll cover the principles and concepts that form the foundation of OOP, such as classes, objects, methods, and properties.

### Classes and Objects
In Dart, classes serve as blueprints for creating objects. In this section, we'll explore how to define classes, create objects from them, and access their properties and methods.

### Inheritance
Inheritance allows you to create new classes based on existing ones, inheriting their properties and behaviors. In this section, we'll delve into inheritance and explore how it can be used to create hierarchical relationships between classes.

### Polymorphism
Polymorphism is a powerful concept in OOP that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. In this section, we'll explore polymorphism in Dart and see how it can enhance code flexibility and extensibility.

### Abstraction
Abstraction helps in creating complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable units. In this section, we'll discuss abstraction and how it can be implemented in Dart through abstract classes and interfaces.

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the practice of hiding internal implementation details and exposing only the necessary interfaces. In this section, we'll learn about encapsulation and its importance in building maintainable and robust Dart applications.

### Interfaces
Interfaces define a contract that classes can implement, ensuring a consistent set of methods and properties. In this section, we'll explore how interfaces work in Dart and how they can be used to define common behavior across multiple classes.

### Mixins
Mixins provide a way to reuse code across multiple class hierarchies. In this section, we'll dive into mixins in Dart and see how they can be used to add functionality to classes without creating inheritance relationships.

We hope you find this repository helpful in mastering Dart OOP. Happy coding!
